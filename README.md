# Carbot Dioxide
I'm practicing making a twitter bot with pretty data visualizations by building a python version of [Clayton Aldern's Carbot Dioxide](https://github.com/clayton-aldern/co2-bot) twitter bot (which is written in R). I've written the script to generate the chart (see the chart below), just need to make the twitter bot which should be easy using tweepy. If I'm ambitious, I could try to create a gristify function in python. Idea credits of course go to Clayton Aldern(https://github.com/clayton-aldern/) and [Grist](https://grist.org/).
